```ruby
words = %w(jump trip laugh run talk)

new_array = words.map do |word|
  word.start_with?("t")
end

p new_array
```
Line 7 returns and ouputs `[false, true, false, false, true]`.

The variable `words` is initialized on line 1 to reference the array object `["jump", "trip", "laugh", "run", "talk"]`.

On line 3, the variable `new_array` is initialized to reference the return value of calling the method `map` on the array object that `words` references, with a block and `word` as the block parameter. `map` iterates through the elements of its caller array and passes each to the block, which then the block parameter references. `map` returns an array object the elements of which are the return values of the block. Within the block, on line 4, the method `start_with?` is called on the string object that `word` references and the string `"t"` as argument. `start_with?` returns `true` if the caller string begins with the argument string. When `word` references `"trip"` and `"talk"`, the block evaluates to `true`; otherwise, the block evaluates to `false`. Therefore, `words.map` on line 3 returns `[false, true, false, false, true]`, which is assigned to `new_array`.

On line 7, the method `p` is called on the array object that `new_array` references. Line 7 both returns and outputs `[false, true, false, false, true]`.
