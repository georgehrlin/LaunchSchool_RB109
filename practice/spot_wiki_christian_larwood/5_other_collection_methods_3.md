```ruby
[1, 2, 3].all? do |num|
  num > 2
end
```
The method call on line 1 returns `false`.

On line 1, the array method `all?` is called on the array object `[1, 2, 3]`, with a block and `num` as the block parameter. `all?`, when called with a block, iterates through the elements of the caller array and returns `true` if for all of the elements of the array the block returns a truthy value. Inside the block, on line 2, the method `>` is called on the integer object that `num` references with `2` as the argument. `>` returns `true` if the caller object is larger than the argument object. Therefore, `all?` on line 1 returns `false`, because when `num` references `1` or `2`, `num > 2` returns `false`.
