```ruby
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.all? do |key, value|
  value.length >= 3
end
```
The method call on line 1 returns `true`.

On line 1, the enumerable method `all?` is called on the hash `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`, with a block and `key` and `value` as the block parameters. `all?`, when called with a block, iterates through the key-value pairs of the hash and returns `true` if for all the key-value pairs the block returns a truthy value. Inside the block, on line 2, the method `length` is called on the string object that `value` references. `length` returns the number of characters of the caller string object. The return value of `length` is then called on with the method `>=` with `3` as the argument. `>=` returns `true` if its caller object is larger than or equal to the argument object. Therefore, `all?` on line 1 returns `true` because all of the values of its caller hash are at least three-character in length.
