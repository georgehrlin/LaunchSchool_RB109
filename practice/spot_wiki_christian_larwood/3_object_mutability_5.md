```ruby
def fix(value)
  value[1] = 'x'
  value
end

s = 'abc'
t = fix(s)
```
Both `s` and `t` reference `"axc"`.

On line 6, the local variable `s` is initialized to reference `'abc'`.

On line 7, the local variable `t` is initialized to reference the return value of calling the method `fix` with the string object that `s` references (`'abc'`) as argument.

The method `fix` is defined from line 1 to 4, with `value` as the method parameter. Within the method, on line 2, the mutating method `[]=` is called on the string object that `value` references with `1` and `'x'` as arguments. `[]=` is a setter method that mutates its caller string object by changing the character at the argument index to the argument string. Therefore, `value` now references `"axc"`. On line 3, `value` is stated. The object that `value` now references is the implicit return value of the method call because this is the method's last evaluated line of expression.

On line 7, `t` is assigned `"axc"`.

`s` also references `"axc"` because the original string object that `s` referenced was passed to `fix` as argument. It was then mutated on line 2 to `"axc"`.
