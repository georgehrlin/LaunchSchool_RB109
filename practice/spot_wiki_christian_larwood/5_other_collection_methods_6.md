```ruby
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.each_with_object([]) do |pair, array|
  array << pair.last
end
```
The method call on line 1 returns `["ant", "bear", "cat"]`.

On line 1, the method `each_with_object` is called on the hash object `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`, with the string object `[]` as the argument, a block, as well as `pair` and `array` as the block parameters. The `each_with_object` iterates through the key-value pairs of the caller hash, returning the key and value in the format of an array in each iteration, and passes the array to the block. The `each_with_object` also passes its argument to the block. Finally, the `each_with_object` returns the argument object after the iteration. Inside the block, on line 2, the mutating method `<<` is called on the array object that `array` references, with the return value of the method call `last.pair` as the argument. `<<` mutates `array` by appending its argument to `array`. The method `last` returns the last element of its caller array. Therefore, in each iteration, `<<` mutates `array` by appending the last element of `pair` to it. In every iteration, `pair` references a key-value pair of the original caller hash but as an array. The value is always the second (and last) element. Therefore, `array` is added every value of the key-value pairs of the caller hash.

Finally, the `each_with_object` returns its argument object, which now references `["ant", "bear", "cat"]`.
