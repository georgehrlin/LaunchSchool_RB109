```ruby
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.any? do |key, value|
  value.size > 4
end
```
The method call on line 1 returns `false`.

On line 1, the hash method `any?` is called on the hash object `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`, with a block and `key` and `value` as the block parameters. When `any?` is called on a hash with a block, it iterates through the key-value pairs of the hash and returns `true` if for any of the key-value pairs the block returns a truthy value. Inside the block, on line 2, the method `size` is called on the string object that `value` references. `size` returns the number of characters of the caller string object. Its return value is then called on by the method `>` with `4` as the argument. `>` returns `true` if the caller object is larger than the argument object. Therefore, the `any?` method call on line 1 returns `false` because none of the values in the caller hash contain more than 4 characters.
