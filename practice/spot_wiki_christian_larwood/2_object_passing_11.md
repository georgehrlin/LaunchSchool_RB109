```ruby
a = [1, 3]
b = [2]
arr = [a, b]
arr[1] = 5 # This is syntactic sugar for arr.[]=(1, 5)

p arr
```

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized to reference an array object `[1, 3]`.

On line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized to reference an array object `[2]`.

On line 3, the local variable `arr` is initialized to reference an array object that is a two-element nested array with the array that `a` references as the first element, and the array that `b` references as the second element. Thus, the array object is `[[1, 3], [2]]`.

On line 4, the array setter method `[]=` is called on the array that `arr` references with `1` as the argumet index and `5` as the argument value. This mutates the element that is on index 1 of the array that `arr` references to `5`, so now `arr` references `[[1, 3], 5]`.

On line 6, the method `p` is called on the array object that `arr` points to. This outputs `[[1, 3], 5]` on the console.

This code example demonstrates the concepts of setter methods as mutating methods and indexing.
