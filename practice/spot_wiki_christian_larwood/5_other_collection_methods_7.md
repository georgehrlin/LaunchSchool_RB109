```ruby
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.each_with_object({}) do |(key, value), hash|
  hash[value] = key
end
```
The method call on line 1 returns `{"ant"=>:a, "bear"=>:b, "cat"=>:c}`.

On line 1, the enumerable method `each_with_object` is called on the hash `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }` with `{}` as the argument, a block, and `key`, `value`, and `hash` as the block parameters. The `each_with_object` iterates through the key-value pairs of the caller hash and passes every key and value to the block as arguments. The `each_with_object` also passes its argument `{}` to the block, which is then referenced by `hash`. Inside the block, on line 2, the hash setter method `[]=` is called on the hash object that `hash` references with `value` and `key` as the arguments in each iteration. `[]=` mutates `hash` by setting new key-value pairs with `value` as its key, and `key` as its value. Therefore, `{}` is mutated to contain all the key-value pairs of the original caller hash but with their values as keys and their keys as values. Finally, the method call on line 1 returns `{"ant"=>:a, "bear"=>:b, "cat"=>:c}`.
